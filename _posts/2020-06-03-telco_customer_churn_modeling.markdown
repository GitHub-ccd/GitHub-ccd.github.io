**About**
Here I outline a project targeted for telecom company customer churn prediction. By analysing TelCo customer data and experimenting with a wide rage of suprevised learning algorithms I've built a model that best fit the customer churn data and make predictions for a imbalanced dataset. 



Updated post is publised on my [blogger](https://findingdata.blogspot.com/2020/06/how-to-retain-telco-customers-via.html).
