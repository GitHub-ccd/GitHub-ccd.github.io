It seems the whole world is in lockdown mode as I start my journey to become a data scientist. Actually, I have started few weeks ago, but my first assignment is to write a blog. In doing research for this task I came to realize the power of blogging. For example, I had no idea for some it is the main source of income and other boosting their own ego and for great many an outlet for creative energy. For me, although is a requirement I'd like to believe this may turn out to be a source of positive energy and outlet for creativity.

Of all the blogs I reviewed to answer the question……….

Why is blogging helpful to a new Data Science student? 

I find the [Rebecca Vickery](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-write-a-data-science-blog-7726c3c7d3d9)'s post on "Medium" was he most inspiring in my opinion. (disclaimer! This wasn’t an exhaustive search by any means). I believe the crops of her argument is based on the philosophy that the process of teaching is by nature non-linear and feedbacks one’s own comprehension. However, one small misunderstanding in this article I’d like to correct is the “[Feynman technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230)”. The actual philosophy referred here i.e. “if you can't explain it you don't know it” was coined by Albert Einstein many years prior to Feynman. Apart from that it’s an excellent article to read and I would highly recommend to Data Science new commers.

I think it's important to review why you do the things you do at regular intervals while you're doing it. Thus, I not only committing to the class work, assignments are projects, do search reviews and wisdom of past students to re-energize myself and to, quite honesty course correct.
