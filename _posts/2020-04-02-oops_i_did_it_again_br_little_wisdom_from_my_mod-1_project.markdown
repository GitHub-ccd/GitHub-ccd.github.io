I will attempt to layout a concise version of my experience of MOD-1 project at Flatiron school. Every time I start something new, may it be a course or a project I always tell myself I’m going to do things early and not leave it till the last minute. Well, guess what “I did it again”…… It’s is amazing to me no matter how old we are at the face of the unknown we behave like scared teenagers. With that negativity I will outline summary of experiences, skills and bit of wisdom 

1. Final exam starts on the 1st lecture. 

As I’ve always told student for years “final exam starts on the 1st lecture”. It seems we’re all so conditioned on linear thinking we always forget simple habits that we all know so intuitively for success. When it comes to goals sense of urgency is much underrated. Most including me apparently always forget that the most important component to solving a problem or finishing a project is to allow time to critically think about it. The tools, methods and exotics codes that provide visualizations to die for mounts to nothing if the conclusions are poorly though out and unclear. You can’t hide that from and intelligible audience. So, start from day one. 

2. Data exploration

I get it. We are all here to do cool things with python and it’s taking over the world. But when push comes to shove, don’t be embarrassed to open a .csv file on Excel. It’s okay, you don’t have to tell anyone. It’ll be our little secret. I don’t know who said this, but “Ego interrupts intuition”. Unfortunately, intuition is exactly what you need at this stage of the game. You’re experience, skill, knowledge and even perception may come handy. The sense you gain at this stage will dictate the quality of your end-product. So, at this stage only one rule matters. Do what ever it takes to know your data. Just look at it for an hour. Plot it!!! Again, before you get the urge to master seaborn to plot it just use excel. Nobody will ever know how you understood your data so well. But you’ll save lot of precious minutes to achieve deadlines. If you think your school has hard deadlines on assignments, how serious do you think your boss will be on future job? 

3.	Collaboration is the key

As a scientist I know all too well the important of collaboration. Collaborations can have a multiplicative effect on the quality of the project. If the hard work you put into the project give a certain outcome, productive collaboration with fellow students will only multiply the quality of that outcome. Also, one gets to learn several unique perspectives of the same problem and a variety of alternative pathways that one might not even find on textbooks. For example, we’ve had few zoom sessions with my classmate Jesse and few others. As Jesse has most programming skills in the class (he is a web designer) he showed a java script to scroll a unusually large web page automatically. 


```
var lastScrollHeight = 0;
function autoScroll() {
  var sh = document.documentElement.scrollHeight;
  if (sh != lastScrollHeight) {
    lastScrollHeight = sh;
    document.documentElement.scrollTop = sh;
  }
}
var id = window.setInterval(autoScroll, 100);
```

This was a great heal as searching for movie information on IMDBpro, which had more than 10,000 records, it was quite time consuming to scroll by hand. This is just one of many methods and ideas I acquired because of collaboration. Also, your classmates may one day be your boss. Or better yet a hiring manager of a company you like so much. Why postpone the networking you can do today on the most natural setting. 

4.	Cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning

As all my fellow classmates know the data files provided for the project was so messy this was practically an exercise on cleaning rather than producing meaningful information. Then again in hindsight, if painful projects and hard-earned skills must be had, I’d much rater have them in class than on the job where outcome might be way more than loosing few points. 

5.	Seaborn is great! Plotly is better
I was very excited to get to learn and practice Seaborn plots as I’ve seen many examples of great looking professional quality plots. But, after sitting in for Rafael’s special topics study group I was blown away. It wasn’t just the plotting either. It was inspiring to see him search for specific issues online and the choices he made to get to a reasonable solution faster. After that I’ve re-did all my figures in my project to Plotly. It was worth it. The dynamic features as well as clarity is quite amazing.
